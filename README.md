In the chaining implementation of a hash table, the worst-case time complexity for insertion involves two main steps:

Hashing to locate the bucket: O(1) on average, but in the worst case (due to hash collisions), it can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the bucket.

Inserting the element into the linked list (bucket): O(k), where k is the number of elements in the bucket. In the worst case, you may need to traverse the entire linked list to find the appropriate position for insertion.

Considering both steps, the worst-case time complexity for insertion in a hash table with chaining is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the hash table.

It's important to note that the actual worst-case scenario is influenced by the quality of the hash function and the distribution of keys, as well as how well the hash table handles collisions. In practice, if the hash function is well-designed and collisions are rare, the average case is often much better than the worst case.
